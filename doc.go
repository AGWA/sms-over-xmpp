// Package sms provides an XMPP component (XEP-0114) which acts as a
// gateway or proxy between XMPP and SMS.  It allows you to send and
// receive SMS messages as if they were XMPP messages.  This lets you
// interact with the SMS network using your favorite XMPP client.
//
// Many users will be satisfied to run the sms-over-xmpp command with
// an appropriate configuration file.  This Go package is intended for
// those who want greater control over their SMS gateway or who wish
// to incorporate the XMPP component into existing Go code.
