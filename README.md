# SMS over XMPP

sms-over-xmpp is an XMPP component (XEP-0114) that acts as a gateway
between an XMPP network and the SMS network.  It allows you to send
and receive SMS messages as if they were XMPP messages, using your
favorite XMPP client.

You send an XMPP message and your friend receives an SMS.  When she
responds by SMS, you receive an XMPP message.
